## Features

📁 File Breakdown:
- ESP32: Organizes data exchange between the camera and Raspberry Pi Pico, prioritizing speed and data integrity.
- Main Logic: Handles core decision-making processes for the robot.
- Open MV: Contains algorithms for ball, goalpost, and line detection using computer vision.

⚽ Ball Detection: Leveraging a regression model and pixel mapping, we determine real-time ball distance and angle. Advanced image processing techniques like LAB values and multi-blob tracking enhance accuracy.

🥅 Goalpost Detection: Utilizing coordinate translation and cosine calculations, we precisely locate goalposts relative to the robot's position using color.

🛤️ Line Detection: Employing grayscale filtering and pixel counting, our algorithm identifies potential obstacles (lines) and navigates around them.

🎮 Robot Control: Integration of 2 PID controllers ensures stable performance:
- Omega PID: Maintains central orientation.
- Translational PID: Guides the robot towards the ball and goalpost.
- Kinematic Equations: Enable omnidirectional movement using 4 wheels.
